# The format of this file is the HELO/EHLO domain followed by an action.
# The action could be OK to allow it, REJECT to reject it, or a custom
# status code and message. Any lines that are prefixed by an octothorpe (#)
# will be considered comments.

# Some examples:
#
# Reject anyone that HELO's with foobar:
# foobar REJECT
#
# Allow the switches to skip this check:
# switch1 OK
# switch2 OK

# Reject anybody that HELO's as being in our own domain(s)
# anyone who identifies themselves as us is a virus/spammer
<%= @domain %> 554 You are not in domain <%= @domain %>
localhost 554 You are not localhost
