### This file managed by Puppet
# Before deploying a rule
# 1. test with an additional "sender==test@domain.org;" in the rule so it
#   only applies to your test account
# 2. then when ready to test for all users, use WARN and watch the logs
#   for a few days and make sure it working the way you like
# 3. Then when ready to deploy for real set a proper error code

## Overrides - make like the following example
# id=exampleuser; sasl_username==exampleuser; action=dunno

## Rules that apply to all senders
# Recipient Per Message Limit
# We only receive mail via smtp from sasl authenticated users
# directly. We want to limit to a lower amount to prevent phished accounts
# spamming

# Message Rate Limit
# This limits sasl authenticated users to no more than 50/60mins
# NOTE: sasl_username needs to be set to something or this check will fail

# Total Recipient Rate Limit
# This adds up the recipients for all the sasl authenticated users messages
# and can't exceed more than 250/60min
